Docker helps with maintaining a consistent environment.  While cacheing layers helps dramatically for certain workflows, something as simple as adding a package can result in long wait times for rebuilding your image.

The alternative could be something more declarative, so long as we can maintain the that 2 images with the same config result in the exact same image.

To illustrate the thought, a simple example of docker may look something along these lines.

\`\``\
FROM ubuntu:16.04 as builder\
COPY . /app

RUN apt-get install -y build-deps\
RUN build -o app

FROM alpine as production\
COPY --from=builder app /app

CMD \["/app"]

\`\``

Whereas it could be more declarative and allow for additional optimization

\`\``

{

  "buildImage": \["ubuntu:16.04"],

  "buildDeps": \["build-deps"],

  "runtimeImage": \["alpine"],

  "

}

\`\``\
\
To really optimize this would require a good understanding of what changes cause steps to need to be rebuilt. However, when doing something as simple as adding a new package to your build image the time can speed up dramatically.  

Adding a package to this requires a full rerun of the layer in docker land.  While this works fine for large companies with everyone on site and local cacheing, it is more painful the slower the internet, and the more distributed the team.

\`\``\
RUN apt-get install -y build-deps

\`\``

This however would make it trivial the container engine to handle local cacheing in a resuable way.

\`\``\
{

  "buildDeps": \["build-deps"],

  ...\
}
